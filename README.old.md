# paragliding-task-checker
A very simple tool to check paragliding tasks.

## Rules
* Did you launch after the window if set
* Were you inside the start cylinder at the start time or did you reenter it before going to the first waypoint?
* Did you then enter the waypoints in order?
* Did you then enter the ESS before the ESS deadline is set?
* Did you then enter the goal cylinder before the Goal deadline if set?
